# Code Standards — KPIT Smart Real-Time CAN Analyser

## General
- Keep every class, service, and component single-purpose — one reason to change
- Fix root causes of bugs; never layer workarounds on top of broken behavior
- Do not mix unrelated concerns in one class — decoding logic stays in Python, persistence stays in Java services, rendering stays in Angular components
- Delete dead code immediately — unused components, routes, console.log calls, and commented-out blocks must not be committed
- Never hardcode environment-specific values (ports, tokens, passwords, URLs) — all config comes from environment variables or application.properties
- Write code that is readable first, clever second — a junior engineer must understand it without asking
- One concern per commit — do not mix bug fixes, refactors, and features in the same commit
- Always audit the current state of a file before modifying it — never assume its contents

## Java (Spring Boot)
- Use constructor injection exclusively — never field injection with @Autowired
- Every public service method must have a clear return type — never return raw Object
- Use @Builder on all JPA entities and DTOs — never construct them with long positional constructors
- Do not declare @ManyToOne or @OneToMany JPA relationships on entities — use scalar FK columns (Long, String) to avoid lazy loading issues and N+1 query explosions
- Wrap all InfluxDB Flux queries and writes in try-catch — InfluxDB errors must never crash the Kafka consumer
- Use @Column(name = "...") explicitly on every JPA field — never rely on implicit column name mapping
- Never call repository methods directly from controllers — always go through a service layer
- All Kafka consumer methods must use manual offset commit — never auto-commit, to prevent data loss on crash
- Remove all System.out.println and debug log statements before committing — use SLF4J @Slf4j logger with appropriate levels (log.info, log.warn, log.error)
- Use @Transactional only on service methods that genuinely need atomicity — not as a default annotation on everything

## Python
- Every Kafka producer and consumer must use manual offset commit — never rely on auto-commit
- Use parse_log_stream() for all log file processing — never parse_log() which loads all frames into memory at once and will crash on 2-hour files
- All XML catalog parsing must happen at startup via CatalogLoaderService equivalent — never re-read XML files inside a per-frame processing loop
- Never publish decoded signals directly from file_worker.py — always publish raw frames to raw-can-frames and let decoder.py handle decoding, to keep the pipeline consistent
- Use argparse for all script configuration — never hardcode Kafka broker URLs, topic names, or catalog paths inside script logic
- All Kafka consumer poll loops must handle KeyboardInterrupt gracefully — publish session COMPLETE to session-meta before exiting
- Remove all print() debug statements before committing — use Python logging module with appropriate levels
- Use generators and yield for frame iteration — never build large lists of frames in memory

## Angular (Frontend)
- Use Angular Signals (signal(), computed(), effect()) for all reactive state — never use BehaviorSubject or Subject for local component state
- Never subscribe to Observables inside component class bodies without unsubscribing — use the async pipe or takeUntilDestroyed()
- Use the inject() function for dependency injection — not constructor parameter injection
- All chart updates must go through the RAF (RequestAnimationFrame) loop — never call chart.update() directly from a WebSocket message handler
- Apply filters (msgId, bus, faultsOnly, anomalyOnly) at the API query level — never filter large arrays in the component after fetching all data
- Never load all frames for a session at once — always use pagination (page + size parameters)
- Keep components dumb — business logic belongs in services, not in component methods
- Every @Input() signal must be initialized with a default value or explicitly typed as input.required()
- Remove all console.log statements before committing
- Never navigate away from the workspace to perform an action (upload, catalog) — use inline panels

## REST API (Spring Boot Controllers)
- Validate and sanitize all path variables and request parameters before any logic runs — prevent path traversal attacks on filename inputs
- Enforce JWT authentication and role authorization before any mutation — never rely on the client to self-report its role
- Return consistent response shapes — success responses always include the relevant entity or confirmation map; error responses always include a message field
- Use ResponseEntity with explicit HTTP status codes — 201 for creation, 204 for deletion, 400 for bad input, 404 for not found, 403 for unauthorized
- Never expose internal stack traces in API error responses — log them server-side only
- All file upload endpoints must validate MIME type and file extension before saving to disk
- Use specific @RequestMapping paths — no wildcard routes that catch unintended requests
- Controller methods must be thin — one call to a service method, then return the response

## Kafka & Messaging
- Topic names are constants — define them once in a shared config class, never repeat string literals
- Producers must handle send failures explicitly — log errors, never silently swallow them
- Consumers must be idempotent where possible — processing the same message twice must not corrupt data
- Batch the WebSocket broadcast using a 16ms buffer window (Sinks.Many + Flux.buffer) — never broadcast frame by frame which would overwhelm connected clients
- The ML anomaly scoring consumer must run in a separate consumer group from the main CanKafkaConsumer — never block frame persistence waiting for ML inference

## Data and Storage
- Signal time-series data belongs in InfluxDB — never store it as a column in MySQL
- Session and frame metadata belongs in MySQL — never query MySQL for time-series replay
- Large files (uploaded log files, generated PDFs) belong on disk under the uploads/ directory — never store binary content as a BLOB in MySQL
- ECU catalog files belong on the filesystem under python_parser/catalogues/ — the MySQL ecu_catalogs table stores only metadata (name, filename, bus_name, is_active), not the XML content
- Never store passwords or JWT secrets in the database or in committed code — use environment variables
- All session deletions must cascade: MySQL frames → MySQL faults → MySQL log file record → InfluxDB points → file on disk — in that order, each step logged
- Use @CreationTimestamp and @UpdateTimestamp on entity audit fields — never set them manually

## Styling (Angular / Tailwind)
- Use Tailwind utility classes exclusively — no inline style attributes, no component-scoped CSS files for layout
- Never hardcode hex color values — use only Tailwind color tokens (e.g. text-green-600, bg-blue-50) or CSS custom properties defined in tailwind.config
- Badge colors must follow the established domain color scheme: green for LIVE/active, gray for COMPLETE, red for faults, orange for anomalies — never invent new badge colors
- Chart colors must follow the signal domain palette defined in the workspace component — never use random colors per render

## API Routes
- Validate and sanitize all path variables and request parameters before any logic runs — prevent path traversal attacks on filename inputs
- Enforce JWT authentication and role authorization before any mutation — never rely on the client to self-report its role
- Return consistent response shapes — success responses always include the relevant entity or confirmation map; error responses always include a message field
- Use ResponseEntity with explicit HTTP status codes — 201 for creation, 204 for deletion, 400 for bad input, 404 for not found, 403 for unauthorized
- Never expose internal stack traces in API error responses — log them server-side only
- All file upload endpoints must validate MIME type and file extension before saving to disk
- Use specific @RequestMapping paths — no wildcard routes that catch unintended requests
- Controller methods must be thin — one call to a service method, then return the response

## Data and Storage
- Signal time-series data belongs in InfluxDB — never store it as a column in MySQL
- Session and frame metadata belongs in MySQL — never query MySQL for time-series replay
- Large files (uploaded log files, generated PDFs) belong on disk under the uploads/ directory — never store binary content as a BLOB in MySQL
- ECU catalog files belong on the filesystem under python_parser/catalogues/ — the MySQL ecu_catalogs table stores only metadata (name, filename, bus_name, is_active), not the XML content
- Never store passwords or JWT secrets in the database or in committed code — use environment variables
- All session deletions must cascade: MySQL frames → MySQL faults → MySQL log file record → InfluxDB points → file on disk — in that order, each step logged
- Use @CreationTimestamp and @UpdateTimestamp on entity audit fields — never set them manually
